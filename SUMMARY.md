- All endpoints require Bearer token (except `/health`)
- Token includes `tenant_id` for rate limiting
- Automatic validation via middleware
- Clear error responses (401 unauthorized)

### 3. Provider Fallback
```
Primary: INLEGALBERT
  ↓ (on failure)
Fallback 1: DeepSeek
  ↓ (on failure)
Fallback 2: Grok
  ↓ (all failed)
Error Response
```

### 4. Rate Limiting
- **Per-minute**: 100 requests/tenant
- **Daily quota**: 10,000 requests/tenant
- **Response**: 429 with retry-after
- **Storage**: In-memory with persistence option

### 5. Request Constraints
- **Timeout**: 30 seconds (enforced by middleware)
- **Payload**: 5 MB maximum
- **Concurrency**: 10 per worker
- **Error codes**: 413 (too large), 504 (timeout)

### 6. Structured Logging
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:45Z",
  "level": "INFO",
  "message": "Inference successful",
  "request_id": "abc-123-xyz",
  "tenant_id": "tenant_123",
  "model": "INLEGALBERT",
  "latency_ms": 245.67,
  "estimated_cost": 0.00123
}
```

### 7. Cost Tracking
- Per-request cost estimation
- Provider-specific rates
- Logged with every inference
- Aggregatable for billing

---

## 📊 Monitoring & Metrics

### Key Metrics
- Request count by endpoint
- Latency (p50, p95, p99)
- Provider usage distribution
- Error rate
- Rate limit hits
- Quota exceeded events
- Cost estimates

### Log Filters
```
# View errors
[Filter: ERROR]

# Track specific tenant
[Search: tenant_id=tenant_123]

# Follow request lifecycle
[Search: request_id=abc-123-xyz]

# Monitor rate limits
[Search: rate_limit_exceeded]
```

## 💰 Cost Estimate

### Infrastructure (Railway)
- **Light dyno**: ~$5/instance/month
- **1-3 instances**: $5-15/month
