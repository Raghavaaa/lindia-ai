## 🎯 Railway Deployment Checklist

### Pre-Deployment ✅
- [x] All code committed and pushed
- [x] Requirements.txt complete
- [x] Procfile configured correctly
- [x] Runtime specified (Python 3.9)
- [x] Railway.json with healthcheck config
- [x] Nixpacks.toml simplified
- [x] Database auto-initialization
- [x] Error handling in place
- [x] Local tests passing

### Railway Setup Required
- [ ] **Connect GitHub repo** to Railway project
- [ ] **Set environment variables** (optional):
  - `JWT_SECRET` - For production (generate with `openssl rand -base64 48`)
  - `DATABASE_URL` - Auto-set if PostgreSQL added
- [ ] **Monitor first deployment** in Railway dashboard

---

## 🚀 Deployment Instructions

### Option 1: Railway Auto-Deploy (Recommended)
1. Railway is watching your GitHub repo
2. Push triggered auto-deployment
3. Wait 2-3 minutes for build
4. Check logs in Railway dashboard

### Option 2: Manual Redeploy
1. Go to Railway dashboard
2. Select your service
3. Click "Deployments"
4. Click "Redeploy" on latest deployment

---

## 🔍 How to Check Deployment Status

### In Railway Dashboard:
1. Go to https://railway.app/
2. Select "legalindia-backend" service
3. Click "Deployments" tab
4. View latest deployment status

### Expected Build Process:
```
✅ Cloning repository...
✅ Detecting Python application
✅ Installing Python 3.9
✅ Running: pip install -r requirements.txt
✅ Installing fastapi, uvicorn, gunicorn, python-multipart...
✅ Build complete
✅ Starting deployment...
✅ Running: gunicorn -w 1 -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker main:app --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT
✅ [INFO] Starting gunicorn 23.0.0
✅ [INFO] Listening at: http://0.0.0.0:XXXX
✅ Initializing database tables...
✅ Database tables ready
✅ Registered router: app.routes.upload
✅ Application startup complete
✅ Healthcheck passed
✅ Deployment successful!
```

## 🧪 Test Your Deployment

Once deployed, get your Railway URL from dashboard, then:

### Test 1: Health Check
```bash
curl https://YOUR-APP.railway.app/

# Expected:
{"service":"LegalIndia Backend","status":"Active","version":"1.0.0"}
```

### Test 2: API Documentation
```bash
# Open in browser:
https://YOUR-APP.railway.app/docs
```

### Test 3: Upload Endpoint (with JWT)
```bash
curl -X POST https://YOUR-APP.railway.app/upload/property \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -F "file=@test.pdf"
```

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### If Deployment Fails:

1. **Check Railway Logs**
   - Dashboard → Your Service → Deployments → View Logs

2. **Common Issues & Solutions:**

| Error | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "Healthcheck failed" | ✅ Already fixed (300s timeout) |
| "pip: command not found" | ✅ Already fixed (nixpacks.toml) |
| "Module not found" | ✅ Already fixed (requirements.txt complete) |
| "Port binding error" | ✅ Already fixed ($PORT in Procfile) |

3. **Try Redeploy**
   - Sometimes fixes build cache issues

4. **Run Local Verification**
   ```bash
   python railway_check.py
   ```

## 📈 Performance Configuration

### Current Settings:
- **Workers:** 1 (optimal for Railway free tier)
- **Worker timeout:** 120 seconds
- **Healthcheck timeout:** 300 seconds
- **Memory:** Optimized for 512MB (Railway free tier)

### To Scale Up (Paid Tier):
- Increase workers in `Procfile`: `-w 2` or `-w 4`
- Add PostgreSQL for persistent data
- Add Redis for caching
