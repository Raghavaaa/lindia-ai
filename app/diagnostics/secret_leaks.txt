SECRET AND CREDENTIAL SCAN RESULTS
===================================

SCAN METHODOLOGY
----------------
Searched for common secret patterns:
- Hardcoded API keys (sk-, ghp-, gho- prefixes)
- Hardcoded tokens and passwords
- Environment variable values
- Database credentials
- JWT secrets

FINDINGS
--------
✓ NO HARDCODED SECRETS DETECTED

All sensitive values are properly loaded from environment variables:
1. DATABASE_URL - from os.getenv()
2. AI_ENGINE_URL - from os.getenv()
3. JWT_SECRET - referenced but not hardcoded
4. API_KEY_SECRET - referenced but not hardcoded

PROPERLY SECURED ITEMS
-----------------------
✓ Database URLs: Read from environment
✓ AI service URLs: Read from environment (with fallback to production URL)
✓ JWT secrets: Not present in code (must be set in environment)
✓ API keys: Authentication mechanism implemented, no hardcoded keys
✓ Passwords: Hashed using passlib, never stored plaintext

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE USAGE
---------------------------
Correct patterns found:
- os.getenv("DATABASE_URL", default)
- os.getenv("AI_ENGINE_URL", default)
- settings.JWT_SECRET (from pydantic-settings)
- settings.API_KEY_SECRET (from pydantic-settings)

RECOMMENDATIONS
---------------
1. Ensure all production secrets are set in Railway/deployment environment
2. Never commit .env files to version control (already in .gitignore)
3. Rotate any secrets that may have been exposed during development
4. Use Railway's secret management for production deployment

AUTHENTICATION SECURITY
------------------------
✓ Passwords hashed with bcrypt via passlib
✓ JWT tokens used for authentication
✓ API key authentication implemented
✓ No plaintext passwords in database or code

FILES CHECKED
-------------
- All Python files (*.py)
- Configuration files
- Requirements files
- Documentation files
- Environment templates

SECURITY BEST PRACTICES FOLLOWED
---------------------------------
✓ Environment-based configuration
✓ No secrets in source code
✓ Password hashing implemented
✓ Token-based authentication
✓ Separation of config from code
✓ .env files in .gitignore

CONCLUSION
----------
✓ No secret leaks detected
✓ Security best practices followed
✓ Safe to proceed with deployment

NOTE: Always verify that production secrets are properly set in the
deployment environment and never exposed in logs or error messages.
