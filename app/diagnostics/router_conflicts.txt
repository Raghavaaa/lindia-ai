ROUTER AND MODULE CONFLICTS ANALYSIS
====================================

DUPLICATE DIRECTORY STRUCTURE FOUND
------------------------------------

1. Routes Duplication:
   - /routes/ (7 files: case.py, client.py, junior.py, property_opinion.py, research.py, test_public.py, upload.py)
   - /app/routes/ (6 files: __init__.py, auth.py, case.py, junior.py, property_opinion.py, research.py)
   
2. Controllers Duplication:
   - /controllers/ (5 files)
   - /app/controllers/ (5 files)
   
3. Models Duplication:
   - /models/ (client.py, upload.py)
   - /app/models/ (client_model.py, user_model.py)

ENTRY POINT INCONSISTENCY
--------------------------
- Dockerfile: Uses "main:app" 
- Procfile: Uses "app.main:app"
- main.py: Uses imports from "routes" (top-level)
- main_old.py: Uses imports from "app.routes" (nested)
- main_fixed.py: Uses imports from "routes" (top-level)

CURRENT WORKING STRUCTURE (based on main.py)
---------------------------------------------
Active Routes (in /routes/):
- junior.py: ✓ WORKING - AI legal junior assistant
- research.py: ✓ WORKING - AI legal research
- case.py: ✗ STUB - TODO comment only
- property_opinion.py: ✗ STUB - TODO comment only
- client.py: ✓ WORKING - but imports from app.schemas/app.models
- test_public.py: ? Not checked
- upload.py: ? Not checked

RESOLUTION STRATEGY
-------------------
1. Keep /routes/, /controllers/, /models/ as canonical (since main.py uses them)
2. Archive /app/ directory to backup branch (it's a duplicate/old structure)
3. Create proper 501 Not Implemented stub handlers for empty routes
4. Ensure all imports are consistent
5. Update Procfile to match Dockerfile (main:app)

EMPTY/STUB ROUTES REQUIRING HANDLERS
-------------------------------------
- /routes/case.py: Currently empty with TODO
- /routes/property_opinion.py: Currently empty with TODO

RECOMMENDATION
--------------
Create lightweight placeholder handlers that:
- Return HTTP 501 Not Implemented
- Log clear message about unimplemented route
- Provide structured JSON response
- Allow application startup to succeed
