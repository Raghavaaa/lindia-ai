================================================================================
NEXT STEPS FOR DEPLOYMENT
================================================================================

IMMEDIATE (Choose ONE):

1. DECISION REQUIRED: Which providers to use in production?
   Options:
   a) AI Engine only (current setup - easiest)
   b) OpenAI as primary (requires OPENAI_API_KEY)
   c) DeepSeek + Groq (cost-effective, requires keys)
   d) Multi-provider with failover (recommended, requires 2+ keys)

2. DECISION REQUIRED: Set production API_SECRET_KEY
   Generate with: openssl rand -hex 32
   Or use any secure random string (min 32 chars)

3. Set environment variables in Railway:
   REQUIRED:
   - RUNTIME_MODE=PROD
   - API_SECRET_KEY=<your-secure-key>
   
   CHOOSE ONE OR MORE PROVIDERS:
   - AI_ENGINE_URL=https://lindia-ai-production.up.railway.app
   OR
   - OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
   - DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=sk-...
   - GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_...

4. Update Railway to use Dockerfile.optimized:
   - Go to Railway project settings
   - Set Dockerfile: Dockerfile.optimized
   - Redeploy

5. Verify deployment:
   - GET /health (should return OK with provider status)
   - GET /metrics (should show statistics)
   - GET /api/v2/management/providers (should list configured providers)
   - POST /api/v2/inference (test with sample query)

6. Monitor for 24-48 hours:
   - Check logs for errors
   - Monitor /metrics endpoint
   - Verify cache hit rates increasing
   - Check rate limiting behavior

  - Deterministic responses
  - All features work normally

PROD MODE (Production):
  RUNTIME_MODE=PROD
  - Uses real AI providers
  - Requires at least one provider API key
  - Full failover and circuit breaker logic
  - Production-grade performance

================================================================================
API ENDPOINTS
================================================================================

CORE INFERENCE:
  POST /api/v2/inference
    - Main endpoint for legal queries
    - Structured responses with citations
    - Provider override support
    - Caching enabled

MANAGEMENT:
  GET  /api/v2/management/providers
  POST /api/v2/management/providers/switch
  POST /api/v2/management/providers/toggle
  GET  /api/v2/management/cache/stats
  POST /api/v2/management/cache/clear

================================================================================
SECURITY NOTES
================================================================================

✓ No secrets committed to repository
✓ All credentials from environment variables
✓ Password hashing with bcrypt
✓ API key authentication required
✓ Prompt injection detection active
✓ Input sanitization on all requests
✓ Rate limiting prevents abuse
✓ Non-root user in Docker
✓ Minimal dependencies reduce attack surface

REQUIRED ACTIONS:
1. Rotate any development secrets before production
2. Set strong API_SECRET_KEY in production
3. Review and set appropriate rate limits
4. Configure Sentry or monitoring (optional)
5. Enable HTTPS in production deployment

================================================================================
ROLLBACK PLAN
================================================================================

If issues arise:

1. Branch rollback:
   git checkout backup-before-provider-abstraction-20251019-complete

2. Or use old main.py:
   - Change Railway start command to use main.py instead of main_v2.py
   - Old code is preserved and functional

3. Or revert to previous deployment:
   - Use Railway rollback feature
   - Previous deployment remains available

Note: New system is additive - old code still works.

================================================================================
TESTING BEFORE PRODUCTION
================================================================================

Run these commands locally (with Python environment):

1. Pre-deploy checks:
   python pre_deploy_check.py

2. Run tests:
   pytest tests/ -v

3. Test with mock provider (LOCAL mode):
   RUNTIME_MODE=LOCAL python main_v2.py
   Then: curl http://localhost:8000/health
         curl http://localhost:8000/api/v2/management/providers

4. Test sample inference:
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v2/inference \
     -H "X-API-Key: your-test-key" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"query": "What is Section 302 IPC?"}'
